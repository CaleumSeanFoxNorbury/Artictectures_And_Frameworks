Related Issues:
Sessions - sessions arnt saving when locating to a different route to which the session was saved. 
Because of this majour, the application has been modified to suit the errors conditions, because this is a demo we find
I think this is acceptable and with future versions this problem will be fixed(with more time).

Unwanted middleware - Due to testing and finding service appropriate to my choices, there is a fair amount of middlware
that when running the command 'npm start' will download and will not be used in this version of code, because of time management 
tghis error will not be fixed and is noticed for future bug fixes in the future.

test failures - with the unit tests the code has some failures within the code and therefore some unit tests will fail
(this is due to the code either not returning what it should or not returning anything at all), again with time management
this will be fixed in future versions.
